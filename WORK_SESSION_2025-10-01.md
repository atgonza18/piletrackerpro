# Work Session Summary - October 1, 2025

## Overview
Enhanced CSV upload functionality with comprehensive column mapping, resolved database schema issues, and fixed pagination problems affecting the blocks display page.

---

## Tasks Completed

### 1. **Enhanced CSV Upload Column Mapping System**

#### Problem
The CSV upload modals (GPS data and Pile Lookup) only mapped a subset of available columns. Users needed the ability to map all database columns from their CSV files, with clear indication of which fields would be auto-calculated or looked up.

#### Solution
- **Updated CSVUploadModal.tsx** to include all mappable columns:
  - **Required fields**: Pile Number, Machine, Start Date, Start Time, Stop Time, Duration, Start Z, End Z
  - **Optional fields**: End Date, Block, Pile Location, Pile Color, Pile Size, Notes
  - **Advanced override fields**: Actual Embedment, Design Embedment, Pile Type, Gain per 30 seconds

- **Added clear formula documentation**:
  - Color-coded labels (amber for formulas, blue for lookups)
  - Inline notes showing calculation formulas
  - Info box explaining all auto-calculations:
    - Actual Embedment (ft): `Start Z - End Z`
    - Embedment (inches): `Embedment × 12`
    - Gain/30 seconds: `Embedment (in) / (Duration (seconds) / 30)`
    - Block: Auto-extracted from Pile Number (e.g., "A1" from "A1.005.03")
    - Embedment w/ Tolerance: `Design Embedment - 1`
    - Embedment Difference: `Embedment w/ Tolerance - Actual Embedment`

- **PileLookupUploadModal.tsx** already had all necessary columns mappable (no changes needed)

#### Files Modified
- `src/components/CSVUploadModal.tsx`

---

### 2. **Database Schema Updates**

#### Problem 1: Missing `pile_location` Column
**Error**: `Could not find the 'pile_location' column of 'piles' in the schema cache`

**Solution**: Added `pile_location` column to the piles table
- Created migration: `db_migration_add_pile_location.sql`
- Updated existing migration: `db_migration_pile_columns.sql`
- Executed migration via Supabase MCP

#### Problem 2: Non-existent `zone` Column
**Error**: `Could not find the 'zone' column of 'piles' in the schema cache`

**Root Cause**: The `zone` column was replaced by `pile_type` in the database schema migration, but code was still trying to insert zone data.

**Solution**: Removed `zone` field from CSV upload data object since it doesn't exist in the database schema. The `notes` column was verified to exist and was kept in the upload.

#### Files Modified
- `src/components/CSVUploadModal.tsx` (removed zone from pile data object)

#### Files Created
- `db_migration_add_pile_location.sql`

---

### 3. **Removed Unique Constraint for Duplicate Support**

#### Problem
**Error**: `ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE command cannot affect row a second time`

**Root Cause**: The database had a unique constraint on `(project_id, pile_number)` which prevented duplicate pile numbers. However, the app has a duplicate comparison feature that requires allowing multiple entries for the same pile.

**Solution**:
1. Dropped unique constraint: `ALTER TABLE piles DROP CONSTRAINT piles_project_id_pile_number_key`
2. Changed from `upsert` to `insert` operation in CSV upload code
3. Removed unique suffix generation from pile numbers
4. Pile IDs are now preserved exactly as they appear in the CSV

**Impact**: Users can now upload duplicate pile records for comparison and historical tracking purposes.

#### Files Modified
- `src/components/CSVUploadModal.tsx` (changed upsert to insert, removed unique suffix)

#### Files Created
- `db_migration_remove_pile_unique_constraint.sql`

---

### 4. **Fixed Manual Pile Modal Error**

#### Problem
**Error**: `loadPiles is not defined` when closing the Manual Pile Modal

**Root Cause**: The modal was calling a `loadPiles()` function that didn't exist in the my-piles page.

**Solution**: Replaced `loadPiles()` calls with `window.location.reload()` to refresh page data after pile creation/editing.

#### Files Modified
- `src/app/my-piles/page.tsx`

---

### 5. **Fixed Blocks Page Not Showing All Blocks**

#### Problem
The blocks page only showed 4 blocks (C3, C5, C6, D1) instead of all 29 blocks that exist in the database (A1-A6, B1-B6, C1-C6, D1-D6, plus blocks 15, 18, 19, 21, 23).

**Root Cause**: Supabase has a default query limit of 1000 rows. With 25,474 total piles, the initial query only fetched the first 1000 piles, which only contained those 4 blocks.

**Solution**: Implemented pagination strategy identical to the my-piles page:
1. First, get exact count of piles with blocks
2. Fetch ALL piles in parallel using `.range(from, to)` in chunks of 1000
3. Use `Promise.allSettled()` to fetch all pages simultaneously
4. Extract unique blocks from the complete dataset

**Result**: All 29 blocks now display correctly on the blocks page.

#### Files Modified
- `src/app/blocks/page.tsx`

---

## Technical Details

### Database Migrations Applied
1. **pile_location column addition**
   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE IF EXISTS piles
   ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS pile_location TEXT;
   ```

2. **Remove unique constraint**
   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE piles DROP CONSTRAINT IF EXISTS piles_project_id_pile_number_key;
   ```

### Key Code Changes

#### CSV Upload - Allow Duplicates
**Before**: Used `upsert` with conflict resolution and added unique suffixes
```javascript
const uniqueSuffix = `_${Date.now()}_${Math.floor(Math.random() * 1000)}`;
pileNumber = `${pileIdValue}${uniqueSuffix}`;

supabase.from('piles').upsert(batch, {
  onConflict: 'pile_number,project_id',
  ignoreDuplicates: false
});
```

**After**: Use simple `insert` with original pile IDs
```javascript
pileNumber = pileIdValue; // Keep original ID

supabase.from('piles').insert(batch);
```

#### Blocks Page - Paginated Data Fetching
**Before**: Single query with limit
```javascript
const { data: pileData } = await supabase
  .from('piles')
  .select('*')
  .eq('project_id', project.id)
  .not('block', 'is', null)
  .limit(50000);
```

**After**: Parallel paginated queries
```javascript
const pageSize = 1000;
const totalPages = Math.ceil(totalCount / pageSize);
const fetchPromises = [];

for (let page = 0; page < totalPages; page++) {
  const from = page * pageSize;
  const to = Math.min(from + pageSize - 1, totalCount - 1);

  fetchPromises.push(
    supabase
      .from('piles')
      .select('*')
      .eq('project_id', project.id)
      .not('block', 'is', null)
      .range(from, to)
  );
}

const results = await Promise.allSettled(fetchPromises);
```

## Testing Results
- ✅ CSV upload with column mapping working for all fields
- ✅ Duplicate pile numbers successfully uploaded (25,474 rows)
- ✅ All 29 blocks now display on blocks page
- ✅ Manual pile modal no longer throws errors
- ✅ Pile lookup data upload working correctly
- ✅ Build successful with no errors

---

## Performance Improvements
- **Blocks Page**: Parallel data fetching using `Promise.allSettled()` loads ~25,000 piles efficiently
- **CSV Upload**: Clear user feedback with formula notes reduces confusion and support requests

---

## Notes for Future Development
1. Consider adding a loading indicator for the blocks page during parallel data fetch
2. The pagination strategy (1000 rows per page) should be consistent across all pages
3. Monitor performance if pile count exceeds 50,000 records
4. Consider indexing the `block` column for faster queries if performance degrades
